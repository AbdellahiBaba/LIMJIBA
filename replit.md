## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing:** Wouter
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui on Radix UI
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with LEMJIBA theme and Montserrat font.
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Localization:** French, Arabic, and English (trilingual) with RTL support. Admin uses `t()` from `useLanguage()` context with locale JSON files (`client/src/locales/en.json`, `fr.json`, `ar.json`). Store uses separate `useStoreLanguage()` context with `client/src/locales/store.ts`. Currency uses MRU everywhere.

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints (`/api/*`)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Storage:** Persistent DatabaseStorage.

### Core Modules
- **Dashboard:** Business statistics, sales, invoices, low stock alerts, quick invoices stat, recent activity feed, clickable low stock alerts, period-filtered KPIs (today/week/month/year), average order value, outstanding credit, top customer, revenue vs expenses comparison. Widget customization with visibility toggles, ordering (move up/down), and localStorage persistence.
- **Stock Management:** CRUD for products, cost price, weight, low stock alerts, favorite products toggle (`isFavorite`), barcode label printing (individual and bulk, Code128 format, 3-column A4 grid layout). Dynamic categories fetched from `/api/categories`.

- **Quick Invoice:** Standalone service invoice generator with auto-numbering (FR-XXXX/YYYY), discount support (% or fixed), saved copies in history, preview and print-ready. Independent from main system (no stock/sales/accounting impact).
- **POS (Point of Sale):** Product grid with favorites section, cart with quick customer name input, checkout, payment modes, receipt printing, recent sales panel, out-of-stock overlays, stock quantity badges, park/hold sale (F3 shortcut) with resume functionality.
- **Sales Management:** View, filter, update, delete, CSV export.
- **Reseller Rewards:** Track purchases, reward pool, random winner draw. Inline unpaid tickets count and outstanding balance columns in reseller list. Account Detail dialog (eye icon) shows summary cards (total sales, unpaid count, total paid, total unpaid) and full sales history table with paid/remaining/status per ticket. Per-sale "Record Payment" inline form (amount + method + confirm) and "Mark All as Paid" bulk action in dialog. Reseller names clickable in Sales page to navigate to resellers. Reusable `ResellerAccountDialog` component. Mobile-responsive tables with hidden columns on small screens.

- **Purchase Orders:** Create/manage POs with auto-numbering (PO-XXXX/YYYY), supplier selection, product line items, status tracking (draft/ordered/received/cancelled), receive action that auto-updates stock + costPrice + creates stock movements. Shipping cost distribution (by quantity or by value) with adjusted unit costs. Page: `/purchase-orders`.

- **Advanced Reporting:** P&L Statement, Sales Analysis, Product Performance, Product Profitability, Batch Profitability tabs with date ranges and CSV export. Page: `/reports`.
- **User Management:** Admin settings page with user CRUD (username, password, display name, role, permissions checkboxes), activate/deactivate users, granular module-level permissions.
- **Global Search (Command Bar):** Ctrl+K or search icon opens a universal search across products, customers, resellers, invoices, and sales.
- **Notification Center:** Bell icon with badge showing low stock warnings, overdue invoices, and credit limit exceeded alerts with dismiss functionality.
- **CSV Export:** Available on all major list pages (Sales, Invoices, Stock, Expenses, Customers, Salaries, Suppliers, Purchase Orders).
- **Shipments:** Logistics documents tracking product movements. Auto-numbered (BT-XXXX/YYYY), three directions (delivery=warehouse→customer, return=customer→warehouse, client_return=client→warehouse), cost breakdown (fuel/driver/other), product line items with weight tracking and display-only unit price/total value. Status flow: pending→in_transit→completed→cancelled. NO stock movements or financial impact — strictly logistics documentation.

- **Customer Auth:** Separate from admin login. Customers can register, login, view profile, and auto-fill checkout. Session stored in `req.session.storeCustomer`.
- **Theme:** Royal Blue (#1B3A6B) + Deep Gold (#C9A84C) + Black (#0A1628) with Montserrat typography.
- **Pages:** home, products, product detail, cart, checkout, orders, about, contact, terms, login, signup, profile.
- **Translation System:** `client/src/locales/store.ts` with full AR/FR/EN translations. `StoreLanguageProvider` + `useStoreLanguage()` hook. Language switcher in store header (EN/FR/عر buttons).
- **RTL Support:** When Arabic selected, `dir="rtl"` set on store container.
- **CMS Pages:** About/Contact/Terms render HTML content via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

### Category Management
- **Table:** `categories` in schema.ts with id, name, nameAr, nameFr, icon, sortOrder, isActive, createdAt.
- **API:** GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/categories` (admin), GET `/api/store/categories` (public).
- **Seeded Categories:** Electronics, Fashion, Home & Living, Beauty & Health, Food & Groceries, Sports & Outdoors, Books & Stationery, Accessories, Other.
- **Stock Integration:** `stock.tsx` fetches categories dynamically from `/api/categories`.

### Customer Authentication
- **Table:** `store_customers` in schema.ts with id, email, passwordHash, fullName, phone, address, language, isActive, createdAt.
- **API Routes:** POST signup/login/logout, GET session/profile, PUT profile at `/api/store/auth/*`.
- **Context:** `client/src/contexts/store-auth-context.tsx` with `StoreAuthProvider` + `useStoreAuth()`.
- **Session:** Uses `req.session.storeCustomer` (separate from admin `req.session.userId`).

### LEMJIBA AI Agent
- AI-powered assistant using OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini via Replit AI Integrations).
- Customer-facing chat widget on all store pages (floating bubble, bottom-right) answers product queries, recommends items, speaks AR/FR/EN.
- Admin-side chat panel at `/limjiba` provides sales insights, restock alerts, promo code generation.
- Backend: `server/limjiba.ts`. Cost optimizations: SHA-256 response cache (30min TTL, 200 max entries, namespaced by mode+context fingerprint), compressed system prompts, history limited to 10 messages with 2000-char assistant truncation.

### Promo Codes
- Full CRUD management at `/promo-codes`. Supports percentage/fixed discounts, min order amounts, max uses, expiry dates. AI-generated promo codes with safe margin calculation.

### Store Orders
- Admin order management at `/store-orders`. View all customer orders, update status (pending→confirmed→shipped→delivered→cancelled), expand for detail view.

### CMS (Content Management)
- Admin CMS at `/cms` with tabs for Pages (home/about/contact/terms editing), Banners (create/toggle/delete promotional banners), and Store Settings (store name, colors, hero text, contact info).

### Data Storage
- **Type:** PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema:** Shared `shared/schema.ts` for type safety between frontend/backend.
- **Key Entities:** Products (with `isFavorite`), Invoices (with `deliveryStatus`, `deliveryCost`), Manufacturing Invoices, Sales (with `deliveryCost`), Resellers, Employees, Salary Payments, Expenses, Customers, Quick Invoices, Suppliers, Purchase Orders (with `shippingCost`), Purchase Order Items (with `shippingCostShare`, `adjustedUnitCost`), Shipments, Shipment Items, Parked Sales, Audit Logs, Users (with roles/permissions), Promo Codes, Store Orders, CMS Pages, CMS Banners, Store Settings, Conversations, Messages, Categories, Store Customers.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Shared Schema Pattern:** Centralized type definitions for consistent data structures.
- **E-Commerce Branding:** LEMJIBA / لمجيبه — Mauritanian premium e-commerce brand.
- **Currency:** MRU (Mauritanian Ouguiya) throughout the entire application.
- **Multilingual Support:** French/Arabic/English with RTL for Arabic. Admin and store have separate translation systems.
- **Stock Deduction:** POS sales automatically update product stock and reseller purchase totals.
- **PostgreSQL Database Architecture:**
    - Production: Requires Neon database (`NEON_DATABASE_URL`) with safety guards.
    - Development: Prefers Neon, falls back to Replit DB (`DATABASE_URL`).
    - Standard `pg` driver with Drizzle ORM, connection pooling, and automatic `search_path`.
    - Migrations via runtime migration in `server/db.ts` `runMigrations()`.
- **Cold-Start Optimization:** In-memory caching (`server/cache.ts`) for frequently accessed data with 30-second TTL.
- **Session Separation:** Admin uses `req.session.userId`, store customers use `req.session.storeCustomer`.
- **Route Ordering:** Specific routes (e.g., `/api/promo-codes/generate`) MUST come before generic `/:id` param routes.
- **Granular Permissions:** `ALL_PERMISSIONS` exported from `shared/schema.ts`.
- **Audit Logging:** `storage.createAuditLog(...)` called in login, user CRUD, supplier CRUD, PO operations, etc. Wrapped in try/catch.
- **serverReady guard:** In `server/index.ts` — critical for startup, do not remove.
- **AI Cache:** Namespaced by `mode` (customer/admin) + context fingerprint — do not break.
